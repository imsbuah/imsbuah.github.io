## 🧠 About Me

I'm a computer science professional with a research-driven approach to systems, software, and security engineering. My academic foundation spans algorithms, data structures, systems programming, and software architecture—applied across both academic labs and real-world environments.

Whether building authentication systems in C++, implementing automated infrastructure, or analyzing threat detection pipelines, I work at the intersection of **engineering precision** and **computational theory**. I focus on scalable design, clean code, and secure, resilient architecture—platform-agnostic and performance-minded.
