## 🧠 About Me

I’m a formally trained computer scientist with a foundation in research, systems thinking, and software engineering. My approach blends academic rigor with practical execution—grounded in core computer science principles such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer architecture, and discrete mathematics.

From designing secure AWS architectures to implementing DevSecOps pipelines and analyzing vulnerabilities in distributed systems, I apply both theory and practice to deliver resilient, scalable, and secure infrastructure. My portfolio reflects not just technical implementation but a deep understanding of computing fundamentals—built in classrooms, labs, and research.
