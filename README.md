## 🧠 About Me

I’m a research-driven software engineer with a background in computer science, specializing in cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and automation. I build secure, scalable systems that align with modern DevSecOps principles and enterprise-ready cloud practices.

My work blends hands-on engineering with a strong analytical mindset—whether architecting secure AWS environments, writing infrastructure as code, or implementing threat detection systems. I thrive in environments where experimentation meets execution, and I take pride in delivering solutions that are robust, auditable, and production-ready.
